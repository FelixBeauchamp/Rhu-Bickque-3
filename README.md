# Rhu-Bickque-3
Projet S4 de la meilleure Ã©quipe

After importing this code in your IDE it is important to add some libraries. We used PyCharm for this proect, so the explanation will be based on that IDE.

The libraries that have to be included are :

  numpy
  
  opencv-python
  
  dynamixel-sdk
  
  Adafruit-PCA9865
  

To add those Packages on Pycharm, go to Settings-> Project:NameofProject-> Python Interpreter-> click the + symbole (Install)->search for the Package to add-> Select it-> Install Package

Do those steps for each package, then the project is ready to go and it will build and execute.

Those libraries will be in the External Libraries-> site-packages

There the documentation on each librairy and funciton will be available.
